aka: Out of Office, OOO
definition:
    An email that is sent automatically in response to receiving an email. Imagine those “out of office” emails you get. Those. Can sometimes refer to triggered email campaigns of any kind, but that’s becoming outdated. Usually used for personal or business email addresses to convey that the recipient is away from their email or no longer uses an address.
