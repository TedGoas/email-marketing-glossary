# Email Marketing Glossary

![Email Marketing Glossary Logo](/assets/og-image.jpg)

The email marketing glossary you always wanted. 

Brought to you by [Jason Rodriguez](https://rodriguezcommaj.com) and [The Better Email](https://thebetter.email). 

## Environment

The Email Marketing Glossary is a fairly simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website. Get started installing Jekyll but [following the guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

It takes advantage of [Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), with each letter section getting its own subdirectory in the overall *Terms* collection. Please maintain this structure when contributing. 

Each entry is a markdown file with the extension `.md`, with the term being defined as the name of the file. 

## Contribution Notes

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request with:

- Additions to the Glossary
- Corrections to existing entries
- Links to additional resources for entries

When writing entries, please include:

- The term name in the `term:` frontmatter of the entry
- Any other interchangeable terms in the `aka:` frontmatter of the entry
- A short definition in the `definition:` frontmatter of the entry
- Any additional information in the body of the entry markdown file
- Links to additional resources after a `## Additional Resources` heading in the body of the entry markdown file
- Some fun, casual, and inclusive language! Keep it lighthearted! 

When in doubt, look at existing entries to see how to format new entries.
